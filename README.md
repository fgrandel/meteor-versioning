# Meteor package for versioned (many-)field (cross-)document writes with eventual consistency, and concurrent version de-/re-activation

### First an example not possible without recreating something like this package

Imagine you have an online shop powered by Meteor. Before you leave the office for the day, you tell your co-worker that one of you should change the description of a specific product, but don't say when. Unaware of each other, you both work quite hard on a new description, and very coincidentally, you both concurrently change the description.

Neither of you notice this. (Your co-worker immediately shuts his laptop and ignores it, satisfied with his change. But by the eventual consistency rules, your description is live, and so you only ever see your description.) During the same session as your first change, you think that there was an error in your description, and since you don't have time to change it now, you copy your description to your notepad for later, and 'undo' your change to the description, and immediately ignore it until the next day.

The next day, your co-worker says that using his new description, you sold many more units. And he was glad his description had been active over night.

This happened because you were using this package, and your co-worker's version of the description had not been undone, and was now the latest version.

### What this package can do for you

**Out-of-the-box Meteor** only provides one way handling concurrent writing to a field in a document: the last write on the field overwrites all other previous writes to that field.

**You may have some problems with this out-of-the-box behavior:**

* Previously-written data will be lost, and will not be accessible unless you record it somewhere
* You cannot easily, flexibly, and atomically write a set of changes to more than one document

This package applies some magic to Meteor collections so they become versioned across documents and collections.

**The benefits of this package are:**

* You can package an arbitrary set of changes across any collections and collection objects into a single version of changes.
* You can deactivate and reactivate a version from the originating client, while concurrent updates continue from other clients.
* You have an automatic server-side trail of all sets of changes.

*The basis of this technology is the study of Conflict-free Replicative Data Types (CRDTs) originally described by people at Inria, a public science and technology institution in France.*


### But while providing some important functions, this package has some limitations that may be relevant to you.

| Limitations |
| --- |
| **No support for allow/deny** |
| No test suite |
| Incomplete *versions* can exist on server failure |
| All versions are persistently-stored server-side, together with metadata |
| No simple API to access specific versions |
| (Cannot track in-field changes. But that could be expected to be as a separate project.) |


There's no specific timeline to remove the limitations. The allow/deny limitation will probably be fixed within the next six months.

But you can you help yourself to remove limitations:

Requirements
---

Meteor introduced compatibility breaking changes with it's version 0.5.7. Due to this:
- Meteor 0.5.5 or 0.5.6: Use version 0.3.1 of this package. This version will no longer be developed.
- Meteor 0.5.7 and onwards: Use the most recent version of this package.


Installation
---

The package can be installed with [Meteorite](https://github.com/oortcloud/meteorite/).

Type inside your application directory:

``` sh
$ mrt add versioning
```

Usage
---

To get you up and running quickly here a simple example:

``` javascript
var tx = Meteor.tx;

// Create a versioned collection.
var Todos = new Meteor.Collection('todos', {versioned: true});

// 1st transaction: insert an object into the collection.
var todoId = Todos.insertOne({
  title: 'Implement undo in my Meteor app',
  details: 'Learn the meteor-versioning package and see whether it does what I need.'
});
tx.commit();

// 2nd transaction: update the object.
Todos.setProperty(todoId, 'details', 'Doesn\'t seem to be difficult...');
tx.commit();
console.log(Todos.findOne()); // The content of the 'details' field is "Doesn't seem to be...".

// Undo the 2nd transaction.
tx.undo();
console.log(Todos.findOne()); // The 'details' field is now: "Learn the meteor-versioning package...".

// Redo the 2nd transaction.
tx.redo();
console.log(Todos.findOne()); // The content of the 'details' field is "Doesn't seem to be..." again.
```


The next example comes with in-depth comments and is more complex to give an overview over the full
functionality of the package. It should work both, on the client and server. This example is in
CoffeeScript for better readability.

``` coffeescript
# Meteor.tx points to the global transaction manager.
tx = Meteor.tx

# Meteor.tx.purgeLog() purges the transaction log.
# The transaction log is just for debugging right
# now. Later we'll use it to retrieve arbitrary past
# model snapshots. In this example we purge the
# log to make sure that prior tests won't be reflected
# in the log.
tx.purgeLog()

# Create a versioned collection. In this example
# we want to represent a directed graph with nodes
# and edges. Edges are saved as nested documents.
# This is to demonstrate that basic OT capabilities
# can be extended to nested subdocuments.
# If you are just versioning a key/value document
# with scalar values then you simply instantiate a
# versioned collection like this:
# myColl = new Meteor.Collection 'myColl', {versioned: true}
# In our example we use a more complex collection to
# demonstrate advanced features:
Nodes = new Meteor.Collection 'nodes',
  versioned: true
  props:
    edges: {type: '[{}]', locator: 'label'}

# This removes all objects from the versioned collection
# including all versioning information. Use this for
# testing or if you really want to start over!
Nodes.reset()

# Generate a test transaction.
initialNodes = [
    name: 'root',
    content: 'Root Node',
    position: { x: 500, y: 100 }
  ,
    name: 'child1',
    content: 'Child Node',
    position: { x: 650, y: 230 }
  ,
    name: 'child2',
    content: 'Child Node',
    position: { x: 350, y: 230 }
  ]
ids = []
for node in initialNodes
  # Meteor.Collection.insertOne() takes a single parameter:
  # the object to be inserted.
  newId = Nodes.insertOne node
  ids.push newId

# Call tx.commit() to actually execute the operations that you staged.
# Commit executes the currently staged operations and automatically
# starts a new transaction. You do not have to start transactions manually.
tx.commit()

for [label, from, to] in [['a', 0, 1], ['b', 0, 2]]
  # Use Meteor.Collection.setProperty() to update
  # your versioned objects.
  #
  # NB: Right now you cannot update several properties at once.
  #
  # The method takes three parameters:
  # 1) The ID of the object you want to change.
  # 2) The name of the property to be changed.
  # 3) The new value.
  #
  # NB: In the case of versioned collections (ordered sub-arrays or nested docs)
  # this actually adds a new element to the collection and does not replace
  # existing elements! In the case of scalar values, the prior value will be
  # replaced.
  Nodes.setProperty ids[from], 'edges', {label: label, to: ids[to]}

tx.commit()

# To roll back a running transaction just emit tx.rollback() and all
# operations you added since the last commit will be "forgotten".
# We don't do this here so that we can demonstrate undo/redo.

# Use Meteor's usual query API to retrieve objects from your versioned
# collection. Observers work normally, too:
allNodes = Nodes.find().fetch()

# To undo the last transaction, simply call:
tx.undo()

# This will undo the last transaction of the current client! (Or if you are
# on the server side then the last transaction committed by the server.) There
# currently is no global undo.
# Undo is multi-level. You can undo as many operations as you like.
# Our OT-algorithm should provide good conflict resolution defaults in case
# other clients have executed concurrent transactions since the undone
# transaction. Observe the state of your collection and tell me if you expected
# different behavior.
# Undoing a transaction will actually not really "roll back" the prior
# transaction but rather execute an opposite (or "inverse") transaction that
# undoes the effect of the prior transaction. This "insert-only" logic is
# necessary for our OT and undo/redo algorithms to work correctly.

# The effect of the last transaction has been undone and our sample object
# collection will no longer contain the 'edges' properties we inserted in
# the last transaction.
nodesWithoutEdges = Nodes.find().fetch()

# To redo the last undone transaction, call:
tx.redo()

# In our example, the edges of the graph have now been restored.
nodesWithEdges = Nodes.find().fetch()

# Redo is multi-level and works with a client-specific undo/redo history, too.
#
# NB: As soon as you commit a new transaction you'll loose your redo
# history (but not your undo history)! This is the usual behavior of
# redo in most programs I know of, so end users shouldn't be too surprised
# of that.
```


Publish/Subscribe
---

`Meteor.publish()` and `Meteor.subscribe()` work normally with versioned
collections.

When you un-/resubscribe from/to a collection then your local undo/redo history
will be purged as it would otherwise contain operations on objects that are
no longer available.


Security
---

All changes to the versioned connection are packaged as transactions and
then funneled through an internal Meteor method. We currently do not check any
security validators (i.e. `Meteor.Collection.allow()/deny()`) in this method.

This means that setting allow/deny rules on a versioned collection will
NOT WORK right now. We'll fix this in a later version.


Cursors
---

Cursors returned by calling `find()/findOne()` on a versioned collection will
work normally. This includes all sub-methods of a cursor, e.g. `forEach()/map()`,
observers, etc.


Latency Compensation
---

Updates to versioned collections have built-in latency compensation. Changes to
versioned collections on the client will be simulated until the server returns
with an authoritative version of the collection.


API reference
---

### Meteor.tx

This is the transaction manager. It contains global functions to commit or roll
back transactions. It also provides the redo/undo feature.

Undo/redo histories are kept separately for all clients. This is the usual behavior
in collaborative systems and avoids that concurrent operations from other users can
be undone.

#### Meteor.tx.commit()

Call this to commit all operations queued since the last `commit()` call.

#### Meteor.tx.rollback()

Call this to roll back the current transaction and "forget" all operations
scheduled since the last `commit()` call.

#### Meteor.tx.undo()

Undo on the last transaction committed by this client (or server). The undo history
is infinite but it is kept in RAM and therefore will not survive a page reload or
server restart.

#### Meteor.tx.redo()

Redo the last undone transaction. The redo history contains all undone transactions
of the local client. It is kept in RAM, too, and will not survive a server restart
or page reload.

Committing a new transaction will purge the redo (but not the undo) stack.

#### Meteor.tx.purgeLog()

Call this to purge the internal transaction log.

The log is currently not actively used. It is great for debugging, though,
and to understand how this Meteor extension actually works.

Have a look at the "transactions" collection in Mongo.

I'm not currently providing a versioning API (i.e. "give me the exact
version of object X at time Y"). It is perfectly possible, however,
to reconstruct all intermediate states of every object from the transaction
log and this will probably be explicitly supported in the future.



### Meteor.Collection(name[, options])

The constructor of `Meteor.Collection` takes two arguments:

1. `name`: The collection name
2. `options` (optional): collection options.
   Please see the Meteor docs for an explanation
   of possible values. We'll only document the
   values added by the versioning smart package.
   The options parameter of Meteor.Collection now
   takes two additional options:
   * `versioned`: Set this to `true` if you'd like to
     instantiate a versioned collection.
   * `props` (optional): If you want to version nested
     documents or nested arrays then you have to
     provide a property specification. This is done
     with one entry per non-default property in the
     props option.
     The key of each entry is the name of the property
     to be specified. The value is an object that
     contains the following entries:
     - `type`: One of '[{}]' or '[*]'. The former
       represents a versioned list of subdocuments
       and the latter a versioned sub-array.
     - `locator` (optional): Only used for versioned
       sub-documents. This specifies the primary key
       of the sub-document list. It will be used to
       distinguish updates from insertions/deletions.
   See the "Usage" section above for an example.

If you are just versioning a key/value document
with scalar values then no property specification is
required:

``` javascript
myColl = new Meteor.Collection('myColl', {versioned: true});
```

NB: The usual mutators `insert()`, `update()` and `remove()`
will not work for a versioned collection and have been
hidden.

For the moment being the mutator API of a versioned
collection is quite different (and much uglier) than
the API of the usual Meteor collection types. We
implement a low-level API that doesn't allow for batch
operations. The only reason is that I don't need anything
more sophisticated myself and I don't have time
right now to implement more unless someone wants to
pay me for it. ;-) In the long term I'd like to implement
the complete MiniMongo API for versioned collections.
Feel free to step in with a pull request if you want
to work in that direction.

For queries you can use the usual Meteor `find()`/`findOne()`
API so you get all of Meteor's query flexibility,
observers, reactivity, etc. as with a normal collection.


#### Meteor.Collection.insertOne(document)

Arguments:

1. `document`: The object to insert to the collection.

Use this to insert an arbitrary new versioned document.

If the object contains sub-arrays or a list of nested
sub-documents then it must conform to the property
specification you provided for the collection!

If the object contains an `_id` property then this
will be used to save the object. Otherwise Meteor will
generate an ID for you.

The method will return the ID of the object.


#### Meteor.Collection.removeOne(id)

Arguments:

1. `id`: The ID of the document to remove.

This method will make the object corresponding to the given ID
"invisible". The object can be restored by calling `Meteor.tx.undo()`
later.


#### Meteor.Collection.setProperty(id, key, value)

Arguments:

1. `id`: The ID of the document to update.
2. `key`: The name of the object property to update.
3. `value`: The new (or additional) value.

This updates the existing object identified by the given ID.

The method behaves differently, depending on whether you are
updating a scalar property or a property that contains a
collection (an ordered array or a keyed list of sub-documents).

When you are updating a scalar value then the new value will
replace the existing value.

When you update a collection then the new value will be added
to the collection. Use `Meteor.Collection.unsetProperty()`
to actually remove an entry (or all entries) from a collection.


#### Meteor.Collection.unsetProperty(id, key[, locator])

Arguments:

1. `id`: The ID of the document to update.
2. `key`: The name of the object property to update.
3. `locator` (optional): When updating a property that
   contains a collection then use the locator to
   remove only a specific entry of the collection
   rather than the whole collection.

This updates the existing object identified by the given ID.

When no `locator` is given then the property (and in the case
of a collection all entries of the collection) will be marked
"invisible".

When you update a collection then you can give a `locator` to
only mark a specific element of the collection "invisible".

In the case of a versioned ordered array, the `locator` is the
index of the array element.

In the case of a versioned unordered (keyed) hash-list of
sub-documents the `locator` represents a value that will be
used to uniquely identify the sub-document to be "hidden".
Meteor looks for the given value in the property that
has been specified as the `locator` property. See the
`props` option of the constructor of `Meteor.Collection`
above.

Hidden elements can be made visible again by calling
`Meteor.tx.undo()`.


#### Meteor.Collection.reset()

Call this to reset the version history of the collection. This will
give you an empty collection without any undo/redo/versioning information.

Only do this if you really want to start over.

NB: This method is only available on the server.


#### Meteor.Collection.find()/findOne()

Please consult the official Meteor documentation for a description
of these methods.


Resource Usage
---
It won't come as a surprise that versioned collections consume considerably
more resources both, on the client and on the server, than a non-versioned collection.

That being said I personally never found versioning to be a space or performance
bottleneck. Reactively updating the DOM in real time (e.g. via Meteor's spark)
is so much slower than keeping versioned objects that I never perceived a difference.
I therefore stick to Donald Knuth's recommendation to avoid premature optimization
when it increases complexity.

If you perceive performance degradation due to object versioning let me know
and I'll try to help you find out where it comes from.



__Space:__

A versioned object needs to be mirrored in a separate collection with its full version
history for all fields plus considerable administrative information necessary to track
the causality of concurrent updates as well as all data necessary for undo and redo.
Have a look at the '_[your collection name]Crdt' collections in the Mongo DB for details.

You also have to be aware that space is even consumed when you delete an object.
Otherwise prior versions could not be recovered.

In practice this is usually not a big problem as disk space is cheap and objects will
only be loaded into RAM when actually being used (i.e. in a query or observer).

On the server side: The same rules apply as to normal Meteor collections with the
exception of deleted objects: While the snapshot version (latest version) will be
removed from RAM, the version mirror will be kept in RAM as long as it is part of
a published collection. This is necessary to enable undo on the server.

On the client side: Space requirements on the client are considerably optimized.
We only copy version information to the client for objects that are actually being
published to the client.

When you re-subscribe to a different selection of client objects then the RAM necessary
to hold prior versioned objects will also be released. This explains why re-subscribing
to a collection will invalidate the undo/redo history: You loose version history locally
when you subscribe to a different partition of the collection. The full version history
is nonetheless kept on disk, of course.


__Time:__

Updating versioned objects is considerably slower than updating non-versioned objects.

This is mainly due to the following additional processing steps:
 1. The transaction framework has a slight overhead over usual updates by
    handling abstract operations.
 2. Updating the internal representation of a versioned collections is considerably
    more complex than updating a non-versioned collection. We have to update both,
    the object snapshot as well as the versioned object mirror.
 3. Taking a snapshot from the versioned mirror consumes quite a few processor cycles
    and must be done whenever an object changes.
 4. Replicating versioned objects accross clients takes longer as more data
    needs to be transferred to the client. This is not a problem in practice
    as latency compensation comes up for this.


Bugs
---

There are no known bugs but the package has not yet been thoroughly tested
across many platforms. If you encounter a bug let me know by posting an issue
to github.


Known Limitations / Todos
---

* Security (allow/deny) does not work for versioned collections.
* The current mutator API is too low-level. We should implement the full
  MiniMongo API. We also should simplify property configuration (e.g.
  discover type by convention).
* We should provide a high-level versioning API.
* We should have a test suite.
* We should implement a versioned text type so that we can track
  and merge in-field changes for strings. This requires implementation
  of a treedoc balancing / treedoc OT protocol.
* There is no good abort() implementation yet if commiting a transaction
  hits a bug. Errors during commit should not occur unless you hit a bug.
  If this happens then your undo/redo stack will most probably be invalid
  and you cannot be sure that you have a consistent database. Please report
  all errors during commit and I'll fix them as quickly as possible.


Package Dependencies
---

The versioning package relies on a simple [logger](https://github.com/jerico-dev/meteor-logger)
and [i18n](https://github.com/jerico-dev/meteor-i18n) implementation. Both have
already been published as packages to the Atmosphere and will be automatically
installed when installing this package.

Have a look at the documentation of the two packages if you'd like to use them in your project.
